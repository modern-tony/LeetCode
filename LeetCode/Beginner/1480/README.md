## Context

Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]...nums[i])`

Constraints:
-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1,1000]`.
-   The value of each element in the array is in the range `[-10^6, 10^6]`

Example:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
